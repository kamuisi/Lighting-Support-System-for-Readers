# Lighting Support System for Readers

This is a mini project from my **Embedded System Design** course. It runs on an **ESP32 microcontroller**, using distance data from an mmwave sensor to control the an LED strip.


## Features

- Automatically turns on the light when someone approaches within **70 cm**, and turns it off when no one is detected  
- Allows users to adjust the ambient light to their preference  
- Includes an auto-calibration button for the sensor when the environment changes
